# week 1... so what happened?
## In class group activity
During the session, we were split into small groups and given the task of making generative design without online coding. 

All we had was paper, a pen and ourselves. 

We managed to create this algorithm that creates faces, depending on what you number you roll out of 6. 

###                   Here were our choices:

###                   Here is what I got after three different tries:

Through this exercise I was definitely able to understand algorithms and generative design a little bit more. To be honest, at the beginning I was completely lost and confused. It also showed me that algorithms aren't strictly online or to do with digital technology, but are applicable across a lot of different mediums and formats. 

It was also super interesting to see what everybody else came up with. We all came up with completely different designs from the same initial set of data. We were also able to see how other groups collaborated and what designs they managed to create with their own algorithms.  

Although this was a fairly simple task, we were able to come out with some interesting designs. Perhaps I can apply this sort of technique later on in the semester?
