# week 5...presentation week EEEK!

Since this week was presentation week, let me give you a run down of what I have in terms of an idea so far...

#### If I'm being honest, I haven't entirely figured it out yet, but basically...

## PATHETIC FALLACY

is my idea. 


### Here is some of my slides to give you an idea of what I was thinking:

In the next coming weeks I'll try to narrow my idea down further, because it's quite broad at the minute.

With everything going on and the limited accessibility to things that I could normally include for this project, I'm trying to think realistically about how I could approach this idea.
