# week 5...presentation week EEEK!

Since this week was presentation week, let me give you a run down of what I have in terms of an idea so far...

#### If I'm being honest, I haven't entirely figured it out yet, but basically...

## PATHETIC FALLACY

is my idea. 


### Here is some of my slides to give you an idea of what I was thinking:

In the next coming weeks I'll try to narrow my idea down further, because it's quite broad at the minute.

With everything going on and the limited accessibility to things that I could normally include for this project, I'm trying to think realistically about how I could approach this idea. 


#### In terms of research...

I came across this really cool installation that was presented by one of the guests for our capstone Wednesday lecture. I really liked the idea of someone being able to sit inside this light cube and completely be immersed by the project. The experience of sitting in the cube and reacting to the sensory sounds and light projections was a major part of this particular project, as it creates an entirely effect when a user immerses themselves in the design this way. 

The project was called SONOS Ray of Sound by Super Nature Design (2018) and looked something like this:

Ideally, I would really like to try something like this. At this point, I'm not sure this is something I'd be able to achieve within this timeframe. It also makes it quite tricky since I would need to buy a projector (or multiple ones), as well as multiple cameras and sensors. Being a broke-ish uni student, this is out of my budget. I would also need to build a set of my own for someone to sit or stand inside. Even though I know it's not possible for this semester, I still like thinking big, so I'll see where I go from here.
