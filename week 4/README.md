# week 4... what idea should I explore?

Our presentation is next week, and I'm not entirely sure of what I want to do. Especially the outputs and different methods I could explore.
My idea is very broad and I'm not sure If I'll be able to narrow it down for my presentation but I'll try exploring and researching more. 

So far, I have decided that I want to explore the idea of Pathetic Fallacy.

It's a literary term that Shakespeare used (particularly in Macbeth), and I always found it to be such an interesting literary term. 

Some examples of pathetic fallacy could include when a character is sad, the weather reflects that emotion and starts raining as a result. It could also include personification of nature, where nature might be described with human emotions, such as a smiling sun or an angry storm (as storms can’t actually be angry and don’t feel emotions) but it’s a way to communicate a mood to a reader and essentially brings inanimate objects to life through literature.

Perhaps I could explore visualing this?

The only issue is, I have no idea where to go from here.

#### I did some research and found this really cool case study.

It's called 'How computers imagine humans?' by João Martinho Moura.

In this project they were able to generate a depiction of a human face on a computer, by using sound as the only data input. 

I found it super interesting how they were able to take something like sound, something that doesn’t have emotions, and is delicate and fickle, and use that to depict a human face in a way that we can easily comprehend.

#### We also had another in-class processing activity.

### This is what the original photo looked like:

I will say this one was a little trickier than some of the other tutorials we learnt, but I found it super fun that we were incoporating the idea of colour tracking in the sketch. Perhaps this is something I could explore further?

Something I also really liked is the interactive element of this particular sketch. When things are interactive it makes the user feel involved and is able to engage them a lot more since they feel like they're contributing to the sketch. 

We also learnt some new tricks that would be super useful if I end up using processing in the future, such as the random function. 

This function allows things to be generated at random rather than relying on the mouse position all of the time. This can make the sketch super unpredictable and messy, but that's all apart of the fun. 

We also learnt how to upload our own images, so I used a photo of my friend Jinni *(I had to crop it to make it fit and it zoomed in pretty close, sorry Jinni).*

### Here are some examples of what I did with that image:

We also did a processing sketch that allowed us to text. Of course I, being the annoying student that I am, decided to use comic sans. 

I'm glad no one else saw my sketch because I probably would have been kicked out of class...

### For our break out group disussion

I explained my (not quite finished) idea and everyone in my group (Alice and Sylvain) had similar feedback:

That my idea was conceptually very strong and unique, but in terms of where I would take that idea futher, I was a little behind. 

This I completely agreed with, but was definitely excited to hear that other people found my idea interesting and were intrigued as to how I could take my idea further.
