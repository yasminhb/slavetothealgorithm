# week 3... non-human design?

### This week we had a go at a fun in-class activity. 

After a bit of discussion we were given 1 hour to break off and create an example of a non-human design (or a non-human machine).

To be honest, I freaked out a bit as I'm not good at quick thinking, but I ran to my garage and rummaged through some some old stuff and managed to come across an old Razor Scooter (what a throwback). I also managed to find a Ripstik board (it's sort of like a weird skateboard). 

I decided to go with the Ripstik board as it relies on a swivel motion to move and therefore the movement of the wheels are quite unpredictable. 

In the process however, I did get told off by a kid living next door for not wearing a helmet... safety first kids. 

### This was my plan:

### So I got my materials ready and gave it a shot.

### So that didn't exactly work...

The string idea turned out to be kind of a fail as the markers were just skidding along and didn't really make any solid marks.

I decided to just tape the markers directly to the board (which ruined the markers sadly) but created some more bold marks as a direct result of the movement created by the board.

### These are the results I got:

#### Kind of ugly, not going to lie, BUT I was able to create a cool example of non-human design. 

Digital Algorithms/Coding makes me a little nervous so doing an activity like this was a little more up my alley.
