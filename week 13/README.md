# week 13...reflection

This has BY FAR been the most rewarding studio I've ever taken in my time here at RMIT. Although coding isn't an area that I'm particularly knowledgeable or great at, it's definitely opened my eyes to the different realms of design (particularly digital design). I've learnt a lot about how you can push design and interesting conceptual ideas in many different ways, as well as a new outlook on user interactions and installations. 

Since my elective was unfortunately cancelled last semester, I have to enroll next semester (2021) for one 12 credit subject. After completing this studio I have already enrolled into visualising data through art as I'm so curious as to how I could explore these sort of design approaches in the future. 

My final sketch definitely wasn't the BEST (I definitely could have improved the project), however prior to this semester I had absolutely zero knowledge or experience in coding and algorithms whatsoever. When I look at it this way, I'm actually really proud of myself and what I achieved this semester. and aat

Although this studio was really difficult and incredibly stressful,  




### Research I've found since

Since completing this project I've already thought of other possible algorithmic projects I could create in the future. Obviously, I would have to do a serious amount of research before starting any new projects (I also need a break this semester was pretty full on, not going to lie).

The world is constantly changing and evolving, especially in this digital age, which is why I think these sort of avenues are the future of design.
