# week 13...reflection

This has BY FAR been the most rewarding studio I've ever taken in my time here at RMIT. Although coding isn't an area that I'm particularly knowledgeable or great at, it's definitely opened my eyes to the different realms of design (particularly digital design). I've learnt a lot about how you can push design and interesting conceptual ideas in many different ways, as well as a new outlook on user interactions and installations. 

Since my elective was unfortunately cancelled last semester, I have to enroll next semester (2021) for one 12 credit subject. After completing this studio I have already enrolled into visualising data through art as I'm so curious as to how I could explore these sort of design approaches in the future. 

My final sketch definitely wasn't the BEST (I definitely could have improved the project), however prior to this semester I had absolutely zero knowledge or experience in coding and algorithms whatsoever. When I look at it this way, I'm actually really proud of myself and what I achieved this semester. 

Although this studio was really difficult and incredibly stressful, it was incredibly rewarding and I would 100% recommend this studio to anyone wanting to take it in the future. 

I felt kind of cool when I was making this project as well :) 

All of my friends who saw my code told me I looked like Mr Robot hacking into a government system, and although I have no idea how to do that it was definitely fun to hear these sort of things. 

I realised that code is essentially another language. When I'm hard on myself about where I came with this project, I think about it this way:
Would I learn french and spanish in two months, and then fly to that country and expect to be fluent? Of course not. I should be really proud of where I've come this semester. I also really want to explore more with non digitla algorithmic design (such as creating sculptures based off of a digital algorithm).


### Research I've found since

I saw this particular installation by Miguel Chevalier called Power Flowers (2017, Shanghai, and really loved how beautiful it was.

It's almost like a large scale projection of a digital garden, and it really makes me want to explore projecting my project in the future. 

I'm in love with bright colours and the use of coloured lighting at night. This particular aesthetic is REALLY up my alley. 

Since completing this project I've already thought of other possible algorithmic projects I could create in the future. Obviously, I would have to do a serious amount of research before starting any new projects (I also need a break this semester was pretty full on, not going to lie).

The world is constantly changing and evolving, especially in this digital age, which is why I think these sort of avenues are the future of design. 


### Last but not least...

I really want to give a BIG THANK YOU to Karen and Andy. You guys were so patient and understanding throughout this really difficult time. I can say confidently that I've grown significantly since taking this studio, and it's because of the amazing work you've put into this class. I really appreciate the fact that you guys listened and understood our concerns, it honestly meant so much to us. I'm really lucky to have been your student and I really look forward to seeing you guys next year for the elective! 

Thank you so much for this semester.
