# week 6...the presentation is over YAY!

Nobody likes doing presentations, and I am certainly no exception to that, so I'm really glad it's now out of the way. 

I will say I'm still lacking with my idea in terms of what I'm actually going to do in the next coming weeks, but I have mid sem break next week which will give me plenty of time to have a good think about it and narrow down my ideas. 

This class was definitely a little more chill than the previous classes, I think this was because everyone needed a break after week 5 and week 6 (the two big presentation weeks). 

I received some good student feedback about my presentation and will continue to explore how I can narrow down my idea. 

Louis suggested adding a little bit of mischief to my project, which I actually really liked the sound of. 

Perhaps I could add a playful mischevious aspect to my project?? I feel like that would be a good reflection of myself. 

### This weeks in-class non-proessing activity is...paper prototyping!

We were put into groups and told to choose a vintage game to recreate with only paper.

My group chose an old Sonic game, I've never played and had no idea how it worked so I relied on Hun to help me out with the technicalities. 

### This is what is looked like:

In this case, it was the background that was moving (not the foreground). 

The background, which had the coins that the character could collect, would constantly move downwards. 

Then the character Sonic could move from left to right in order to collect the coins and gain points. 

It was done fairly quickly and looks really bad but it was a good example of how to show someone how the game would work in an interactive sense (without having to spend weeks coding a prototype). 

### Time for another processing activity.

This time Karen taught us how to incorporate sound into our sketches. 

Since sound is something that I want to work with, whether that be input or output, I was super excited to learn how to incoporate it into our processing sketches.

Unfortunately with processing, file size can't be that big so I was fairly limited with my sound choices (I was sad I couldn't choose an upbeat banger).

However, I was able to find something that was a small file size and learn how to make the visuals interact and respond to the sound I inputted.
