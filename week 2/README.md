# week 2... starting to get a little bit more tricky


### I had another go at making an algorithm (non digital)

This time we were asked to do a "12 hour challenge". I thought to myself, what is something I do multiple times everyday without fail or doubt?

### TEA


It's tea time...

So I made a system to try and determine what I would have that day. 

Let's just say the first try was a FAIL. I ended up getting peppermint tea with MILK. NOT GOOD.

Karen then suggested I add a 'if' option. That way If I managed to get black tea, I could then have the option to add milk or not, rather than adding milk to tea that isn't supposed to have milk in it. 

### This is the chart

#### I decided to try again.

This time I tried it with the new chart that included the 'if' option. 

I managed to get a nice cup of tea :) 

I ended up making a nice cup of english breakfast in my cat cup with brown sugar!



#### Then things started to get really tricky...

We started to move on to something called processing... this was looking more at digital coding

#### IT WAS REALLY HARD

To say I was a little confused would be a great understatement.

Nevertheless, I had a go at creating a little character of my own. 

### This is my character

Cute isn't it?

I had a go at remixing another classmate's character by making it interactive! 

### This is the original character

### This is my attempt of a remix

Depending on which way you move your mouse the background and facial features move!
