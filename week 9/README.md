# week 9...so much work

I've spent a good amount of time testing out different functions of the p5 play library that Karen reccomended. 

I eventually came to a conclusion that animating the background in javascript like the other sketches I found is actually MUCH more complex that I originally thought.

I've decided to draw all of the backgrounds and the animations by hand. This way I can add more details to the visuals (backgrounds and the sprites), whilst also making it easier for me to animate. 

I don't think I'll be able to animate the transitions smoothly as I previously wanted, as I don't have enough time before the deadline, and it would be an incredibly long and complex process. 

After playing around with p5 play I found out that they have an easy animation function, meaning I wouldn't have to create a sprite sheet and a separate .json file to create frames. This means I only have to upload the .png files in order (which is a lot less work).

### These are the backgrounds I created!

#### Sad
*INSERT PHOTOS*

#### Angry
*INSERT PHOTOS*

#### Surprised
*INSERT PHOTOS*

#### Neutral
*INSERT PHOTOS*

#### Disgusted
*INSERT PHOTOS*

I got the animation to work in p5 play but it turned out like this:

*INSERT GIF* 

I just need to figure out how to adjust the frame rate which shouldn't be too hard. 

I did discover that you can't resize animations in the code because it breaks the animation and they remain static.
This means I'll have to go and resize all of the images separately (which will take a while and be a bit tedious, but it's a neccessary step!). 

### These are the flower animations I made:

#### Happy
*INSERT PHOTOS*

#### Sad
*INSERT PHOTOS*

#### Angry
*INSERT PHOTOS*

#### Surprised
*INSERT PHOTOS*

#### Neutral
*INSERT PHOTOS*

#### Disgusted
*INSERT PHOTOS*

I also need to work on how to combine the facial tracking code with the animation sketch that I made. 

This will be really tricky, and if I'm being honest I don't think I'll be able to get it done by the deadline. 
Even so, I have a clear idea and I'm happy with how my project is progressing (even if I don't finish on time).
