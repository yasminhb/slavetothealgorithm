Karen suggested I explore the use of p5.play and sprites in order to create my animated garden.

I had no idea what it was and thought she was talking about the soft drink at first, so I decided to look into it.

Sprites are commonly used for video game animations, and are commonly used for characters in particular.

#### Here is an example of sprites frames:

I came across a block based visual programming language called 'Scratch', which uses sprite characters in order to create interactive animations.

#### I had a go at creating another mockup, here is what it looked like:

Obviously I couldn't include the face tracking/emotion tracking portion of my idea but this was a good introduction to sprite characters and how it can be used for animation. 

My only concern is that the animation might not be that smooth if I do it this way. I think I need to look into how to animate on p5.play smoothly.

#### This is an example of what the 'code' blocks looked like:
