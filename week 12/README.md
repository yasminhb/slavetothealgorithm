### The Code

#### Facial Tracking

A quick run down and summary of my code (I cleaned it up a LOT):

*INSERT IMAGE OF FACIAL TRACKING*

This code was entirely created by Web Dev Simplified via:
*INSERT LINK*

It uses the face.api library, and was slightly remixed by me in order to fit my particular idea.

#### Emotion Detection

Emotion detection is included as part of the code by Web Dev Simplified (ADD NAME OF GUY), however, I created an array using objects and values in order to gather information and use it as an input.

This can be seen here:
*INSERT IMAGE*

Here I was able to define all of the emotions as numbers, meaning I could take the largest data set and connect it with my next function.

This can also be seen in my console (screen shot taken from a few weeks ago and is no longer available in the current console):

*INSERT IMAGE*

#### Background Images

As I hand drew all of the images, this part of the code was actually quite easy. I loaded all of the images in and then used the if{} function in order to be selective with what is shown and drawn to the screen (depending on the emotion shown by the user).

This is what loading the background images looks like in the code:

*INSERT IMAGE OF LOADING*

*INSERT IMAGE OF IF BACKGROUND = HAPPY*
