# week 10...making good progress!!!

Last week I had drawn up all of my backgrounds and animations. This weeks challenge was to put them all together and combine the facial tracking code (my script.js and my sketch.js). This was honestly my biggest challenge as I really had NO IDEA how to do it. 

#### This is what the animations and backgrounds look like when put together:

### UPON FURTHER INSPECTION I DISCOVERED SOMETHING...

I didn't realise there was an entirely new EMOTION that was apart of the facial tracking code that I completely OVERLOOKED!

I have NO IDEA how I managed to overlook the fact that the facial tracking code had included 'fearful' as an emotion. 

Perhaps because this is one of the harder emotions to recreate? I had never seen this emotion pop up on my screen when I was testing the emotion detection.

I googled 'fearful expression' and this is what came up:

So I gave it a go and...

IT WORKED?? Apparently this is what you look like when you're scared and I've almost mastered this expression.
The hands covering the chin is the key.

What does this mean? It means I had to quickly draw a new background and complimentary animations. 
Thankfully I had a quick sketch from a few weeks back for what I would have done if I had 'fearful' as one of the emotions and ran with that. 

#### This is what I came up with:

### now...onto the code portion
