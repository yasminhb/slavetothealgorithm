#### Statement (PDF Version):
This project I’ve created over the semester is a digital garden that reacts and responds to your emotions, or more accurately your facial expressions. In other words, it’s a visual twist on pathetic fallacy. The garden has a total of seven different states for seven different facial expressions: happy, sad, neutral, angry, surprised, disgusted and fearful. The garden fluctuates as your emotions do. The work also includes various sounds that each accompany a specific state of the garden. 

This work is made with p5.js, using a facial tracking and emotion detecting library known as face.api to determine your emotions via your webcam once you grant access. Your facial expressions will be detected using this library and will create a set of data based on the expression values. The highest number in the data set is then concluded as the registered facial expression. This data is then used as an input and the animated garden will respond to your facial expressions accordingly. The animations are created using p5.play and display several images in a sequence in order to create a successful animated garden. All of the images were hand drawn in procreate, with each animation being at least 18 different frames. Accompanying sound is also available to the user using the mousePressed() function.

This work aims to challenge and experiment with the idea of pathetic fallacy, as well as our connection to nature as humans. It also aims to highlight the parallels between us and nature, and how the environment is constantly challenging itself (these consequences aren’t always what we expect). For example, when there is the appearance of an angry storm, the sky darkens and explodes with aggressive thunder and lightning. However, storms actually help to spread seeds with its powerful wind and rain, and helps to regrow many species of flora. Realistically, a smiling sun may appear harsh to many plants, and too much sun may be the cause of its death. Through this work I aim to explore this contrast in nature and its connection to fickle human emotions. It also aims to explore how our environment and nature can influence our own emotions. To eliminate the natural sense of narcism that humans have, the work purposely does not show the users web cam live view. Sound is also included in the work to accompany the different states of the garden and further the experience for the user. Sound is optional due to it using the mousePressed() function, and you may choose whether or not to include this function in the experience.
